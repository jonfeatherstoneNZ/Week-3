Peer-graded Assignment: Week 3: Histopathologic Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project
This Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection) is a binary image classification problem where you will identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.

The project has 125 total points. The instructions summarize the criteria you will use to guide your submission and review others' submissions. Note: to receive total points for this section, the learner doesn't need to have a top-performing score on the challenge. As a mini-project to complete as a weekly assignment, we don't expect you to iterate over your project until you have a model capable of winning the challenge. The iterative process takes time, so please start early to get better-quality results and reports. The learner needs to show a score that reasonably reflects that they completed the rubric parts of this project. The grades are more based on the quality and depth of the analysis, not just on a better Kaggle score.
